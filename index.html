								Kgp presented me with unprecedented scale of diversity of oppotunity. My five years of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview. My experience with the Inter-IIT Basketball team showed me the power of empathetic leadership. My tenure throwing major, campus-wide events validated that quality stems from attention to detail. My engagement in KPG's tech and innovation initiatives exercised my creative muscle, sparked my obsession with technology, and strengthened my tolerance of adversity.
								<br><br>
								KGP showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love for learning, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers.
